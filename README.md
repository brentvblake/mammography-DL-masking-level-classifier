# Mammogram Masking Level Classification using Deep Learning

## Project Overview

Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women worldwide. Early detection through mammography can significantly improve the prognosis and survival rates. However, the classification of mammograms by the level of cancer masking - low, medium, or high - remains a challenge due to the subtle differences that need to be discerned. This project aims to leverage deep learning techniques to accurately classify mammograms based on cancer masking levels.

Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the goal is to achieve high accuracy and recall in classifying mammograms into the three levels of cancer masking from a synthetic dataset. This could not only assist radiologists in making more informed decisions but also pave the way for more reliable automated systems in the future.
